Atalanta UI Library

[Installing Fractal](https://fractal.build/guide/installation.html)
Requires Node.js

CSS and Javascript files are in /public
Components and related files are in /components

To run Fractal, enter the following in the command line: fractal start --sync

A Fractal component should have HTML in a .hbs file and related descriptions in a .yml file.
To keep components compartmentalized, I also include any required assets in the component's folder
